8.Class schedule(10 points):
I want you to create a table that shows your weekly class schedule.  This is easy to do using table elements, but it does require some attention to detail.  
    a.Make a level-2 header titled “class schedule”
    b.Create a table with 6 columns.  
    c.Set the border size to 1, so I can see the borders for each cell.  Set the cell spacing to 3, and set the cell padding to 3.
    d.The header row should have a blank cell, followed by cells for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.  If you have a Saturday class (you poor soul), you can add a sixth column (or not, I don’t care, really).
    e.Going down the left side of the table, I want you to list out the hours of your week-day in 30-minute increments.  You can start as early as you feel necessary.
    f.List the classes you have as cells.  Use the row-span element to block out as many 30-minute cells as you need for each item.  If you have stuff that starts at an odd time, then guess.  I won’t care, as long as it doesn’t look all wonky.
    g.Fill up your schedule.  Make stuff up if you have to.  I want to see at least four classes that run M-W-F or Tu-Th or every weekday.  In addition to classes, You can put your employment, your work-out time, your commute time, or anything else you like.
    h.Use the rowspan attribute, so if you have an hour-long class, the cell should take up two rows, without a line between them.When doing your weekly schedule, make sure your table doesn’t show any of the following errors or I will deduct points:
        i. Extra blank cells at the end of a row
        ii. Block of time that takes a whole hour, but uses two separate cells
        iii. Missing cells
