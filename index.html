        This is the cheesy nonsense you really should have expected when you
        asked someone to compose a poem.

      <h2>My personal interests</h2>
      <p>
        You're killing me man. You seriously want
        <span class="emphasize">three</span> paragraphs from me while I'm trying
        to get this completed?! I do enough writing in my other classes, I don't
        need this from you too!
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, fine, let's talk about what I like to do. I've been mostly trapped
        at home since the pandemic. I was expecting to get a job as a test
        proctor, but then that plan was dashed before it even really got off the
        ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I just stay at home. I finish my homework 1-2 days before it's due,
        then I play video games and with my cat, sometimes sprinkling in
        personal projects as well.
      </p>
