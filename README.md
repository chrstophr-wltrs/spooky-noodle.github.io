# Project 1

## Github &amp; Personal Profile Webpage

I did the following style options:

1. [x] CSS3 Web Fonts
1. [x] Background Parallax
1. [x] Nav Menu
   1. [x] Sticky
   1. [x] Highlight Content When Clicking Navbar
1. [x] Sticky footer

I'll be honest, when you described this:

**(10 points) sticky nav with auto-highlight**

1. As you scroll through your document, your sticky nav menu should highlight the section that is topmost in your viewport.
1. W3Schools has code to do this. Look it up.

I had a pretty good idea of what you were describing, but I couldn't find any tutorial about how to **do** it. There was nothing, especially from W3Schools.
